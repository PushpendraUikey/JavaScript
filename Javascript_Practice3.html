<!--
    Objects are used to store values, they can store multiple values. Store value in a key-value pair.

    Object methods: methods are similar to functions. They enable some action to be performed on an object. 
    Difference between a function and method is that a method associated with the object and it can be 
    accessed using the dot operator.

                                        ARRAY 
        - Indexing starts from 0 and goes to n-1.
        Properties of Array:
        constructor: To return the function which created prototype for Array object.
        length: To set or return the count of elements in an array.
        prototype: To add properties and methods to arrays. 

        Methods of Array:
        concat():          To concatenate two or more arrays and return a copy of the combined arrays.
        indexOf():         Find the array for an element and return its position in the array.
        join():            Joins all elements of an array into a single string.
        lastindexOf():     To return the index of the last element of an array.
        pop():             To remove the last element of an array and returns that element.
        push():            To add new elements to the array and return the new length. 
                           Newly added elements will be present at the end of the array.
        reverse():         To reverse the order of the elements of the array.
        shift():           To remove the first element of an array and return removed element.
        slice():           To select a part of an array and return the new array.
        sort():            To sort the elements of an array. 
        splice():          To add/remove element from an array.
        toString():        To remove an array to a string and return its result.
        unshift():         To add new elements to the beginning of an array, and returns the new length 
        valueOf():         To return the primitive value of an array.
-->

<!--
    toString() method is used to represent an object as string.
    Syntax: objectName.toString();

    Array: To convert an array into string.
    Boolean: If 'true' then returns the string "true", else return the string "false".
    Date: return the textual representation of the date.
    Error: To return a string displaying the corresponding error message.
    Function: Whatever the function returns convert it into string then return.
    Number: To return the textual representation of the number.
    String: To return the value of the String object.
-->

<!--
    valueof() method is used to return the primitive type of object.
    Array: To return the instance of an array.
    Boolean: To return the Boolean value.
    Date: To return the stored time value in milliseconds since midnight, January1, 1970 UTC
    Fuction: To return the function itself.
    Number: To return the numeric value.
    Object: To return the object (this is the defualt value)
    String: To return the string value.
-->

<!--
    "this" is a keyword in javascript. The value of "this" is not determined when it is declared instead it's evaluated during runtime.
    When a function is called from the object using either dot or square bracket, this refers to current object.
